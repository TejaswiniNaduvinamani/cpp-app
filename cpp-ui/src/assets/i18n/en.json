Each Audit must be conducted at GFSâ€™ corporate office or one of its satellite offices, as reasonably determined by GFS. Customer may review up to 20 individual Products (by GTIN) for all distribution centers in one GFS pricing period per Audit, but in no case exceeding six months from the date of the Audit. The list of individual Products to be included in the Audit must be provided to GFS along with the written notice of the Audit. The Audit will consist of reviewing the accumulated Cost and GFSâ€™s calculation of the sell price. GFS will provide a spreadsheet showing the Cost used to determine the sell price, as well as the Mark-Up and final Sell Price. GFS will provide in hard copy form, evidence of Cost from the supplier by either mail or by electronic delivery (810 EDI transactions) via itradenetworktm  (a business to business electronic transaction service provider) for all Products that are not subject to a Vendor Contract. For Products subject to a Vendor Contract, GFS will provide a copy of the Vendor Contract used to determine the Contract Cost. All information provided by GFS in connection with an Audit may not be removed from GFSâ€™ premises, including, but not limited to, any summaries, copies, or reproductions. If Customer requests a third party be present during an Audit, the third party must sign a confidentiality agreement in form and substance acceptable to GFS.  Due to the extensive time and complexity associated with an Audit, computer generated price matching or electronic price audits are not permitted.",

Cross-Dock Fees and Transfers Fees between GFS distribution centers may be included in the Cost of certain Products. Cost may also include fees assessed by GFS for brand labeling of up to 1% on Products that are branded to GFS or a trade name used exclusively by GFS, and other fees for vendor nonâ€�compliance with GFS's standard payment program. Cost is not reduced by cash discounts for prompt payment that GFS may receive. Cost is also not reduced for payments, such as performance-based incentives, or fees, or allowances GFS receives for marketing, freight management, warehousing, distribution, or quality assurance that it provides for vendors.",
    "SELL_PRICE_FIRST": "Except as otherwise set forth in Section 6 of the Agreement the price for the Products will be Cost on the date of the order plus the applicable category mark-up set forth in below (the â€œMark-Upâ€�).
